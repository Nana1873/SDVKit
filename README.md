# SDVKit

SDVKit is an agent-friendly Stardew Valley modding toolkit and isolated live test lab.

This repository is a clean greenfield rebuild. The current code is intentionally only a small, buildable CLI scaffold; features are added through focused GitHub issues and reviewable pull requests.

## Product direction

SDVKit has two equal pillars:

- **Toolkit:** inspect, create, build, test, and package SMAPI mods and content packs.
- **Live lab:** launch Stardew through an isolated SMAPI mod group, keep controlled runs active in the background, use a disposable test save, and collect focused test evidence.

The default live path will use SMAPI's native `--mods-path` support. SDVKit will not require Mod Organizer 2 and will not automatically deploy into the normal or mod-manager-owned `Mods` directory.

## Non-goals

- No generic automation or evidence framework.
- No second MCP/runtime stack without a concrete missing capability.
- No broad save parser, save migration engine, multiplayer lab, or crash-recovery system before a real workflow requires it.
- No game binaries, proprietary assets, or personal saves in this repository.

## Build

Requirements: Windows and the .NET 8 SDK selected by `global.json`.

```powershell
dotnet restore SDVKit.sln
dotnet build SDVKit.sln -c Release --no-restore
dotnet test SDVKit.sln -c Release --no-build
& .\src\SdvKit.Cli\bin\Release\net8.0\sdvkit.exe --help
```

## Read-only foundation commands

```powershell
sdvkit doctor --json
sdvkit project inspect [path] --json
```

`doctor` checks the supported Windows custom-targets, Steam (including additional libraries), GOG, and Xbox locations. An installation is ready only when the Stardew Valley and SMAPI executables and assemblies are present together. Its versioned JSON reports `ready`, `ambiguous`, or `notFound` and lists only complete installations.

`project inspect` reads the selected directory, or the current directory when no path is given. It classifies manifests as `smapiMod` through `EntryDll`, or `contentPack` through `ContentPackFor.UniqueID`; a tree containing separate manifests of both kinds is `hybrid`. Required identity fields and the classification fields are checked, but this is not a replacement for SMAPI's complete manifest schema validation. Project and manifest paths within the result are relative and sorted. `bin`, `obj`, `.git`, and `.sdvkit` directories are ignored, and child directory links are not followed.

Both commands are read-only. They do not create `.sdvkit`, inspect saves or a normal `Mods` directory, deploy files, or launch the game. Exit code `0` means a ready or recognized result, `2` is a CLI usage error, and `3` is a controlled discovery or inspection outcome such as not found, ambiguous, or invalid.

## First milestones

1. Environment discovery and project inspection.
2. Minimal SMAPI mod/content-pack creation, build, and release packaging.
3. Isolated SMAPI launch through `--mods-path`.
4. A small always-on game bridge for controlled background runs.
5. One disposable test-save workflow and focused scenario smoke tests.

The issue tracker is the roadmap. A capability is added only when it serves a current workflow and can reuse no smaller existing path.

## Inspiration

The product shape is inspired by [skyrimvr-claude-toolkit](https://github.com/WingedGuardian/skyrimvr-claude-toolkit). The live-lab design also studies [StardewValley-MCP](https://github.com/luy-0/StardewValley-MCP) and the bootstrap approach of [stardew-valley-ai-modkit](https://github.com/liminalwarmth/stardew-valley-ai-modkit). No source from those projects is included in this initial scaffold.
